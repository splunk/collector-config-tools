  - name: create_service_timeseries
    kind: bool
    default: false
    doc: |
      CreateServiceTimeSeries, if true, this will send all timeseries using `CreateServiceTimeSeries`.
      Implicitly, this sets `SkipMetricDescriptor` to true.
  - name: instrumentation_library_labels
    kind: bool
    default: true
    doc: |
      InstrumentationLibraryLabels, if true, set the instrumentation_source
      and instrumentation_version labels. Defaults to true.
  - name: service_resource_labels
    kind: bool
    default: true
    doc: |
      ServiceResourceLabels, if true, causes the exporter to copy OTel's
      service.name, service.namespace, and service.instance.id resource attributes into the GCM timeseries metric labels. This
      option is recommended to avoid writing duplicate timeseries against the same monitored
      resource. Disabling this option does not prevent resource_filters from adding those
      labels. Default is true.
  - name: cumulative_normalization
    kind: bool
    default: true
    doc: |
      CumulativeNormalization normalizes cumulative metrics without start times or with
      explicit reset points by subtracting subsequent points from the initial point.
      It is enabled by default. Since it caches starting points, it may result in
      increased memory usage.
  - name: sum_of_squared_deviation
    kind: bool
    default: false
    doc: |
      EnableSumOfSquaredDeviation enables calculation of an estimated sum of squared
      deviation.  It isn't correct, so we don't send it by default, and don't expose
      it to users. For some uses, it is expected, however.

    Timeout is the timeout for every attempt to send data to the backend.
- name: sending_queue

  - name: max_interval
    type: time.Duration
    kind: int64
    default: 30s
    doc: |
      MaxInterval is the upper bound on backoff interval. Once this value is reached the delay between
      consecutive retries will always be `MaxInterval`.
  - name: max_elapsed_time
    type: time.Duration
    kind: int64
    default: 5m0s
    doc: |
      MaxElapsedTime is the maximum amount of time (including retries) spent trying to send a request/batch.
      Once this value is reached, the data is discarded.
