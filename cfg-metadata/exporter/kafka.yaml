    A zero timeout means no timeout.
- name: sending_queue
  type: exporterhelper.QueueSettings
  kind: struct
  doc: |
    QueueSettings defines configuration for queueing batches before sending to the consumerSender.

    ResolveCanonicalBootstrapServersOnly makes Sarama do a DNS lookup for
    each of the provided brokers. It will then do a PTR lookup for each
    returned IP, and that set of names becomes the broker list. This can be
    required in SASL environments.

    default: true
    doc: |
      Whether to maintain a full set of metadata for all topics, or just
      the minimal set that has been necessary so far. The full set is simpler
