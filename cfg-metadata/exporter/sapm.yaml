    kind: int
    default: 10
    doc: |
      NumConsumers is the number of consumers from the queue. Defaults to 10.
      If batching is enabled, a combined batch cannot contain more requests than the number of consumers.

    kind: int
    default: 1000
    doc: |
      QueueSize is the maximum number of batches allowed in queue at a given time.
  - name: storage
    type: '*component.ID'
