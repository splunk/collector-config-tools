  Config defines configuration for file storage extension.
fields:
- name: directory

    CompactionConfig defines configuration for optional file storage compaction.
  fields:
  - name: on_start
    kind: bool
    default: false
    doc: |
      OnStart specifies that compaction is attempted each time on start
  - name: on_rebound
    kind: bool
    default: false
    doc: |
      OnRebound specifies that compaction is attempted online, when rebound conditions are met.
      This typically happens when storage usage has increased, which caused increase in space allocation
      and afterwards it had most items removed. We want to run the compaction online only when there are
      not too many elements still being stored (which is an indication that "heavy usage" period is over)
      so compaction should be relatively fast and at the same time there is relatively large volume of space
      that might be reclaimed.
  - name: directory
    kind: string
    default: /var/lib/otelcol/file_storage
    doc: |
      Directory specifies where the temporary files for compaction will be stored
  - name: rebound_needed_threshold_mib
    kind: int64
    default: 100
    doc: |
      ReboundNeededThresholdMiB specifies the minimum total allocated size (both used and empty)
      to mark the need for online compaction
  - name: rebound_trigger_threshold_mib
    kind: int64
    default: 10
    doc: |
      ReboundTriggerThresholdMiB is used when compaction is marked as needed. When allocated data size drops
      below the specified value, the compactions starts and the flag marking need for compaction is cleared
  - name: max_transaction_size
    kind: int64
    default: 65536
    doc: |
      MaxTransactionSize specifies the maximum number of items that might be present in single compaction iteration
  - name: check_interval
    type: time.Duration
    kind: int64
    default: 5s
    doc: |
      CheckInterval specifies frequency of compaction check
  - name: cleanup_on_start
    kind: bool
    default: false
    doc: |
      CleanupOnStart specifies removal of temporary files is performed on start.
      It will remove all the files in the compaction directory starting with tempdb,
      temp files will be left if a previous run of the process is killed while compacting.
- name: fsync
  kind: bool
  default: false
  doc: |
    FSync specifies that fsync should be called after each database write
