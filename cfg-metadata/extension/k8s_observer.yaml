  Config defines configuration for k8s attributes processor.

    How to authenticate to the K8s API server.  This can be one of `none`
    (for no auth), `serviceAccount` (to use the standard service account
    token provided to the agent pod), or `kubeConfig` to use credentials
    from `~/.kube/config`.
- name: node
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    Node is the node name to limit the discovery of pod, port, and node endpoints.
    Providing no value (the default) results in discovering endpoints for all available nodes.
    For example, node name can be set using the downward API inside the collector
    pod spec as follows:

    env:
      - name: K8S_NODE_NAME
        valueFrom:
          fieldRef:
            fieldPath: spec.nodeName

    Then set this value to ${env:K8S_NODE_NAME} in the configuration.
- name: observe_pods
  kind: bool
  default: true
  doc: |
    ObservePods determines whether to report observer pod and port endpoints. If `true` and Node is specified
    it will only discover pod and port endpoints whose `spec.nodeName` matches the provided node name. If `true` and
    Node isn't specified, it will discover all available pod and port endpoints. `true` by default.
- name: observe_nodes
  kind: bool
  default: false
  doc: |
    ObserveNodes determines whether to report observer k8s.node endpoints. If `true` and Node is specified
    it will only discover node endpoints whose `metadata.name` matches the provided node name. If `true` and
    Node isn't specified, it will discover all available node endpoints. `false` by default.
