type: '*attributesprocessor.Config'
doc: |
  Config specifies the set of attributes to be inserted, updated, upserted and
  deleted and the properties to include/exclude a span from being processed.
  This processor handles all forms of modifications to attributes within a span, log, or metric.
  Prior to any actions being applied, each span is compared against
  the include properties and then the exclude properties if they are specified.
  This determines if a span is to be processed or not.
  The list of actions is applied in order specified in the configuration.

- name: include
  type: '*filterconfig.MatchProperties'
  kind: ptr
  doc: |
    Include specifies the set of input data properties that must be present in order
    for this processor to apply to it.
    Note: If `exclude` is specified, the input data is compared against those
    properties after the `include` properties.
    This is an optional field. If neither `include` and `exclude` are set, all input data
    are processed. If `include` is set and `exclude` isn't set, then all
    input data matching the properties in this structure are processed.

      Action specifies the type of action to perform.

                Either Value, FromAttribute or FromContext must be set.

      UPSERT -  Performs insert or update action depending on the attributes
                containing the key. The key/value is inserted to attributes
                that did not originally have the key. The key/value is updated
                for attributes where the key already existed.
                Either Value, FromAttribute or FromContext must be set.
      DELETE  - Deletes the attribute. If the key doesn't exist,

      HASH    - Calculates the SHA-1 hash of an existing value and overwrites the
                value with its SHA-1 hash result. If the feature gate
                `coreinternal.attraction.hash.sha256` is enabled, it uses SHA2-256
                instead.
      EXTRACT - Extracts values using a regular expression rule from the input
                'key' to target keys specified in the 'rule'. If a target key
                already exists, it will be overridden.
      CONVERT  - converts the type of an existing attribute, if convertable
      This is a required field.
