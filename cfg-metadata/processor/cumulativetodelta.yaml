type: '*cumulativetodeltaprocessor.Config'
doc: |
  Config defines the configuration for the processor.
fields:
- name: max_staleness
  type: time.Duration
  kind: int64
  doc: |
    MaxStaleness is the total time a state entry will live past the time it was last seen. Set to 0 to retain state indefinitely.
- name: initial_value
  type: tracking.InitialValue
  kind: int
  doc: |
    InitialValue determines how to handle the first datapoint for a given metric. Valid values:

      - auto: (default) send the first point iff the startime is set AND the starttime happens after the component started AND the starttime is different from the timestamp
      - keep: always send the first point
      - drop: don't send the first point, but store it for subsequent delta calculations
- name: include
  type: cumulativetodeltaprocessor.MatchMetrics
  kind: struct
  doc: |
    Include specifies a filter on the metrics that should be converted.
    Exclude specifies a filter on the metrics that should not be converted.
    If neither `include` nor `exclude` are set, all metrics will be converted.
    Cannot be used with deprecated Metrics config option.
  fields:
  - name: match_type
    type: filterset.MatchType
    kind: string
    default: ""
  - name: regexp
    type: '*regexp.Config'
    kind: ptr
    doc: |
      Config represents the options for a NewFilterSet.
    fields:
    - name: cacheenabled
      kind: bool
      default: false
      doc: |
        CacheEnabled determines whether match results are LRU cached to make subsequent matches faster.
        Cache size is unlimited unless CacheMaxNumEntries is also specified.
    - name: cachemaxnumentries
      kind: int
      doc: |
        CacheMaxNumEntries is the max number of entries of the LRU cache that stores match results.
        CacheMaxNumEntries is ignored if CacheEnabled is false.
