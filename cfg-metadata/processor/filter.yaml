  Config defines configuration for Resource processor.
fields:
- name: error_mode
  type: ottl.ErrorMode
  kind: string
  default: propagate
  doc: |
    ErrorMode determines how the processor reacts to errors that occur while processing an OTTL condition.
    Valid values are `ignore` and `propagate`.
    `ignore` means the processor ignores errors returned by conditions and continues on to the next condition. This is the recommended mode.
    `propagate` means the processor returns the error up the pipeline.  This will result in the payload being dropped from the collector.
    The default value is `propagate`.
