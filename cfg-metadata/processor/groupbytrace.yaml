fields:
- name: num_traces
  kind: int
  default: 1000000
  doc: |
    NumTraces is the max number of traces to keep in memory waiting for the duration.
    Default: 1_000_000.
- name: num_workers
  kind: int
  default: 1
  doc: |
    NumWorkers is a number of workers processing event queue.
    Default: 1.
- name: wait_duration
  type: time.Duration
  kind: int64
  default: 1s
  doc: |

    Default: 1s.
- name: discard_orphans
  kind: bool
  default: false
  doc: |
    DiscardOrphans instructs the processor to discard traces without the root span.
    This typically indicates that the trace is incomplete.
    Default: false.
    Not yet implemented, and an error will be returned when this option is used.
- name: store_on_disk
  kind: bool
  default: false
  doc: |
    StoreOnDisk tells the processor to keep only the trace ID in memory, serializing the trace spans to disk.
    Useful when the duration to wait for traces to complete is high.
    Default: false.
    Not yet implemented, and an error will be returned when this option is used.
