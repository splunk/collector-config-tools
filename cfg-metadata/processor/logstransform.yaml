type: '*logstransformprocessor.Config'
doc: |
  Config defines configuration for Resource processor.
fields:
- name: operators
  type: '[]operator.Config'
  kind: slice
  doc: |
    Config is the configuration of an operator
  fields:
  - name: builder
    type: operator.Builder
    kind: interface
- name: storage
  type: '*component.ID'
  kind: ptr
  doc: |
    ID represents the identity for a component. It combines two values:
    * type - the Type of the component.
    * name - the name of that component.
    The component ID (combination type + name) is unique for a given component.Kind.
- name: retry_on_failure
  type: consumerretry.Config
  kind: struct
  doc: |
    Config defines configuration for retrying batches in case of receiving a retryable error from a downstream
    consumer. If the retryable error doesn't provide a delay, exponential backoff is applied.
  fields:
  - name: enabled
    kind: bool
    default: false
    doc: |
      Enabled indicates whether to not retry sending logs in case of receiving a retryable error from a downstream
      consumer. Default is false.
  - name: initial_interval
    type: time.Duration
    kind: int64
    doc: |
      InitialInterval the time to wait after the first failure before retrying. Default value is 1 second.
  - name: max_interval
    type: time.Duration
    kind: int64
    doc: |
      MaxInterval is the upper bound on backoff interval. Once this value is reached the delay between
      consecutive retries will always be `MaxInterval`. Default value is 30 seconds.
  - name: max_elapsed_time
    type: time.Duration
    kind: int64
    doc: |
      MaxElapsedTime is the maximum amount of time (including retries) spent trying to send a logs batch to
      a downstream consumer. Once this value is reached, the data is discarded. It never stops if MaxElapsedTime == 0.
      Default value is 5 minutes.
