type: '*memorylimiter.Config'
doc: |
  Config defines configuration for memory memoryLimiter processor.
fields:
- name: check_interval
  type: time.Duration
  kind: int64
  doc: |
    CheckInterval is the time between measurements of memory usage for the
    purposes of avoiding going over the limits. Defaults to zero, so no
    checks will be performed.
- name: limit_mib
  kind: uint32
  default: 0
  doc: |
    MemoryLimitMiB is the maximum amount of memory, in MiB, targeted to be
    allocated by the process.
- name: spike_limit_mib
  kind: uint32
  default: 0
  doc: |
    MemorySpikeLimitMiB is the maximum, in MiB, spike expected between the
    measurements of memory usage.
- name: limit_percentage
  kind: uint32
  default: 0
  doc: |
    MemoryLimitPercentage is the maximum amount of memory, in %, targeted to be
    allocated by the process. The fixed memory settings MemoryLimitMiB has a higher precedence.
- name: spike_limit_percentage
  kind: uint32
  default: 0
  doc: |
    MemorySpikePercentage is the maximum, in percents against the total memory,
    spike expected between the measurements of memory usage.
