    AllowAllKeys is a flag to allow all span attribute keys. Setting this
    to true disables the AllowedKeys list. The list of BlockedValues is
    applied regardless. If you just want to block values, set this to true.

    AllowedKeys is a list of allowed span attribute keys. Span attributes
    not on the list are removed. The list fails closed if it's empty. To
    allow all keys, you should explicitly set AllowAllKeys
- name: ignored_keys
  type: '[]string'
  kind: slice
  doc: |
    IgnoredKeys is a list of span attribute keys that are not redacted.
    Span attributes in this list are allowed to pass through the filter
    without being changed or removed.
- name: blocked_values
  type: '[]string'
  kind: slice

    BlockedValues is a list of regular expressions for blocking values of
    allowed span attributes. Values that match are masked
- name: summary
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    Summary controls the verbosity level of the diagnostic attributes that
    the processor adds to the spans when it redacts or masks other
    attributes. In some contexts a list of redacted attributes leaks
    information, while it is valuable when integrating and testing a new
    configuration. Possible values are `debug`, `info`, and `silent`.
