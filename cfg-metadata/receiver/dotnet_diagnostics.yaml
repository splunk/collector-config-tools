  ScraperControllerSettings defines common settings for a scraper controller
  configuration. Scraper controller receivers can embed this struct, instead
  of receiver.Settings, and extend it with more fields if needed.
fields:
- name: collection_interval
  type: time.Duration
  kind: int64
  default: 1s
- name: pid
  kind: int

    The process ID of the dotnet process from which to collect diagnostics. This
    process ID is used to generate the file glob "dotnet-diagnostic-%d-*-socket"
    to locate a file in TMPDIR (or "/tmp" if unset). If the file is found, it is
    used as a Unix domain socket (on Linux/Mac) to communicate with the dotnet
    process. For ease of use, this receiver is intended to be used with an
    observer and receiver creator for process discovery and receiver creation.
- name: counters
  type: '[]string'
  kind: slice
  doc: |
    A list of counters for the dotnet process to send to the collector. Defaults
    to ["System.Runtime", "Microsoft.AspNetCore.Hosting"]. Available counters can
    be displayed by the `dotnet-counters` tool:

- name: local_debug_dir
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    LocalDebugDir takes an optional directory name where stream data can be written for
    offline analysis and troubleshooting. If LocalDebugDir is empty, no stream data is
    written. If it has a value, MaxLocalDebugFiles also needs to be set, and stream
    data will be written to disk at the specified location using the naming
    convention `msg.%d.bin` as each message is received, where %d is the current
    message number.
- name: max_local_debug_files
  kind: int
  doc: |
    MaxLocalDebugFiles indicates the maximum number of files kept in LocalDebugDir. When a
    file is written, the oldest one will be deleted if necessary to keep the
    number of files in LocalDebugDir at the specified maximum.
