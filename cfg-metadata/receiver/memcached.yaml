type: '*memcachedreceiver.Config'
doc: |
  ScraperControllerSettings defines common settings for a scraper controller
  configuration. Scraper controller receivers can embed this struct, instead
  of receiver.Settings, and extend it with more fields if needed.
fields:
- name: collection_interval
  type: time.Duration
  kind: int64
  default: 10s
- name: endpoint
  kind: string
  default: localhost:11211
  doc: |
    Endpoint configures the address for this network connection.
    For TCP and UDP networks, the address has the form "host:port". The host must be a literal IP address,
    or a host name that can be resolved to IP addresses. The port must be a literal port number or a service name.
    If the host is a literal IPv6 address it must be enclosed in square brackets, as in "[2001:db8::1]:80" or
    "[fe80::1%zone]:80". The zone specifies the scope of the literal IPv6 address as defined in RFC 4007.
- name: transport
  kind: string
  default: ""
  doc: |
    Transport to use. Known protocols are "tcp", "tcp4" (IPv4-only), "tcp6" (IPv6-only), "udp", "udp4" (IPv4-only),
    "udp6" (IPv6-only), "ip", "ip4" (IPv4-only), "ip6" (IPv6-only), "unix", "unixgram" and "unixpacket".
