  doc: |
    Endpoint configures the address for this network connection.
    For TCP and UDP networks, the address has the form "host:port". The host must be a literal IP address,
    or a host name that can be resolved to IP addresses. The port must be a literal port number or a service name.
    If the host is a literal IPv6 address it must be enclosed in square brackets, as in "[2001:db8::1]:80" or
    "[fe80::1%zone]:80". The zone specifies the scope of the literal IPv6 address as defined in RFC 4007.

    default: ""
    doc: |
      MaxVersion sets the maximum TLS version that is acceptable.
